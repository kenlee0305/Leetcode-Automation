# 38. Reverse Words in a String
### Difficulty: Medium
Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words. <br/> A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space. <br/> Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space. <br/> Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces. <br/>   <br/><b>- Example</b> 1: <br/> Input: s = "the sky is blue" <br/> Output: "blue is sky the" <br/> <br/><b>- Example</b> 2: <br/> Input: s = "  hello world  " <br/> Output: "world hello" <br/> Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces. <br/> <br/><b>- Example</b> 3: <br/> Input: s = "a good   example" <br/> Output: "example good a" <br/> Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string. <br/> <br/><b>- Example</b> 4: <br/> Input: s = "  Bob    Loves  Alice   " <br/> Output: "Alice Loves Bob" <br/> <br/><b>- Example</b> 5: <br/> Input: s = "Alice does not even like bob" <br/> Output: "bob like even not does Alice" <br/>   Constraints: <br/> 1 <= s.length <= 104 <br/> s contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces ' '. <br/> There is at least one word in s. <br/>   Follow-up: If the string data type is mutable in your language, can you solve it in-place with O(1) extra space?
