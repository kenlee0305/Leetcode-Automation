# 27. Partition List
### Difficulty: Medium
Given the head of a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x. <br/> You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions. <br/>   <br/><b>- Example</b> 1: <br/> Input: head = [1,4,3,2,5,2], x = 3 <br/> Output: [1,2,2,4,3,5] <br/> <br/><b>- Example</b> 2: <br/> Input: head = [2,1], x = 2 <br/> Output: [1,2] <br/>   Constraints: <br/> The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 200]. <br/> -100 <= Node.val <= 100 <br/> -200 <= x <= 200
