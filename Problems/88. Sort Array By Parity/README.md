# 88. Sort Array By Parity
### Difficulty: Easy
Given an array nums of non-negative integers, return an array consisting of all the even elements of nums, followed by all the odd elements of nums. <br/> You may return any answer array that satisfies this condition. <br/>   <br/><b>- Example</b> 1: <br/> Input: nums = [3,1,2,4] <br/> Output: [2,4,3,1] <br/> The outputs [4,2,3,1], [2,4,1,3], and [4,2,1,3] would also be accepted. <br/>   Note: <br/> 1 <= nums.length <= 5000 <br/> 0 <= nums[i] <= 5000
