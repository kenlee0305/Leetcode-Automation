# 56. First Bad Version
### Difficulty: Easy
You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad. <br/> Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad. <br/> You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which returns whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API. <br/>   <br/><b>- Example</b> 1: <br/> Input: n = 5, bad = 4 <br/> Output: 4 <br/> Explanation: <br/> call isBadVersion(3) -> false <br/> call isBadVersion(5) -> true <br/> call isBadVersion(4) -> true <br/> Then 4 is the first bad version. <br/> <br/><b>- Example</b> 2: <br/> Input: n = 1, bad = 1 <br/> Output: 1 <br/>   Constraints: <br/> 1 <= bad <= n <= 231 - 1
