# 70. Sort Characters By Frequency
### Difficulty: Medium
Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters, and return the sorted string. <br/>   <br/><b>- Example</b> 1: <br/> Input: s = "tree" <br/> Output: "eert" <br/> Explanation: 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once. <br/> So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer. <br/> <br/><b>- Example</b> 2: <br/> Input: s = "cccaaa" <br/> Output: "aaaccc" <br/> Explanation: Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer. <br/> Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together. <br/> <br/><b>- Example</b> 3: <br/> Input: s = "Aabb" <br/> Output: "bbAa" <br/> Explanation: "bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect. <br/> Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters. <br/>   Constraints: <br/> 1 <= s.length <= 5 * 105 <br/> s consists of English letters and digits.
