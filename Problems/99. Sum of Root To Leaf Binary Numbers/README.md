# 99. Sum of Root To Leaf Binary Numbers
### Difficulty: Easy
You are given the root of a binary tree where each node has a value 0 or 1.  Each root-to-leaf path represents a binary number starting with the most significant bit.  For example, if the path is 0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1, then this could represent 01101 in binary, which is 13. <br/> For all leaves in the tree, consider the numbers represented by the path from the root to that leaf. <br/> Return the sum of these numbers. The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bits integer. <br/>   <br/><b>- Example</b> 1: <br/> Input: root = [1,0,1,0,1,0,1] <br/> Output: 22 <br/> Explanation: (100) + (101) + (110) + (111) = 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 22 <br/> <br/><b>- Example</b> 2: <br/> Input: root = [0] <br/> Output: 0 <br/> <br/><b>- Example</b> 3: <br/> Input: root = [1] <br/> Output: 1 <br/> <br/><b>- Example</b> 4: <br/> Input: root = [1,1] <br/> Output: 3 <br/>   Constraints: <br/> The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000]. <br/> Node.val is 0 or 1.
