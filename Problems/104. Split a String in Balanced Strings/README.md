# 104. Split a String in Balanced Strings
### Difficulty: Easy
Balanced strings are those that have an equal quantity of 'L' and 'R' characters. <br/> Given a balanced string s, split it in the maximum amount of balanced strings. <br/> Return the maximum amount of split balanced strings. <br/>   <br/><b>- Example</b> 1: <br/> Input: s = "RLRRLLRLRL" <br/> Output: 4 <br/> Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRLL", "RL", "RL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'. <br/> <br/><b>- Example</b> 2: <br/> Input: s = "RLLLLRRRLR" <br/> Output: 3 <br/> Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "LLLRRR", "LR", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'. <br/> <br/><b>- Example</b> 3: <br/> Input: s = "LLLLRRRR" <br/> Output: 1 <br/> Explanation: s can be split into "LLLLRRRR". <br/> <br/><b>- Example</b> 4: <br/> Input: s = "RLRRRLLRLL" <br/> Output: 2 <br/> Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRRLLRLL", since each substring contains an equal number of 'L' and 'R' <br/>   Constraints: <br/> 1 <= s.length <= 1000 <br/> s[i] is either 'L' or 'R'. <br/> s is a balanced string.
