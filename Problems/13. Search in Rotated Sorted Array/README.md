# 13. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
### Difficulty: Medium
There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values). <br/> Prior to being passed to your function, nums is rotated at an unknown pivot index k (0 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]. <br/> Given the array nums after the rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums. <br/> You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity. <br/>   <br/><b>- Example</b> 1: <br/> Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0 <br/> Output: 4 <br/> <br/><b>- Example</b> 2: <br/> Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3 <br/> Output: -1 <br/> <br/><b>- Example</b> 3: <br/> Input: nums = [1], target = 0 <br/> Output: -1 <br/>   Constraints: <br/> 1 <= nums.length <= 5000 <br/> -104 <= nums[i] <= 104 <br/> All values of nums are unique. <br/> nums is guaranteed to be rotated at some pivot. <br/> -104 <= target <= 104
