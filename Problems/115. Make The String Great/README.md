# 115. Make The String Great
### Difficulty: Easy
Given a string s of lower and upper case English letters. <br/> A good string is a string which doesn't have two adjacent characters s[i] and s[i + 1] where: <br/> 0 <= i <= s.length - 2 <br/> s[i] is a lower-case letter and s[i + 1] is the same letter but in upper-case or vice-versa. <br/> To make the string good, you can choose two adjacent characters that make the string bad and remove them. You can keep doing this until the string becomes good. <br/> Return the string after making it good. The answer is guaranteed to be unique under the given constraints. <br/> Notice that an empty string is also good. <br/>   <br/><b>- Example</b> 1: <br/> Input: s = "leEeetcode" <br/> Output: "leetcode" <br/> Explanation: In the first step, either you choose i = 1 or i = 2, both will result "leEeetcode" to be reduced to "leetcode". <br/> <br/><b>- Example</b> 2: <br/> Input: s = "abBAcC" <br/> Output: "" <br/> Explanation: We have many possible scenarios, and all lead to the same answer. For example: <br/> "abBAcC" --> "aAcC" --> "cC" --> "" <br/> "abBAcC" --> "abBA" --> "aA" --> "" <br/> <br/><b>- Example</b> 3: <br/> Input: s = "s" <br/> Output: "s" <br/>   Constraints: <br/> 1 <= s.length <= 100 <br/> s contains only lower and upper case English letters.
