# 95. Squares of a Sorted Array
### Difficulty: Easy
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order. <br/>   <br/><b>- Example</b> 1: <br/> Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10] <br/> Output: [0,1,9,16,100] <br/> Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100]. <br/> After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100]. <br/> <br/><b>- Example</b> 2: <br/> Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11] <br/> Output: [4,9,9,49,121] <br/>   Constraints: <br/> 1 <= nums.length <= 104 <br/> -104 <= nums[i] <= 104 <br/> nums is sorted in non-decreasing order. <br/>   Follow up: Squaring each element and sorting the new array is very trivial, could you find an O(n) solution using a different approach?
