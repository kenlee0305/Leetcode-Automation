# 101. Height Checker
### Difficulty: Easy
A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single file line in non-decreasing order by height. Let this ordering be represented by the integer array expected where expected[i] is the expected height of the ith student in line. <br/> You are given an integer array heights representing the current order that the students are standing in. Each heights[i] is the height of the ith student in line (0-indexed). <br/> Return the number of indices where heights[i] != expected[i]. <br/>   <br/><b>- Example</b> 1: <br/> Input: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3] <br/> Output: 3 <br/> Explanation:  <br/> heights:  [1,1,4,2,1,3] <br/> expected: [1,1,1,2,3,4] <br/> Indices 2, 4, and 5 do not match. <br/> <br/><b>- Example</b> 2: <br/> Input: heights = [5,1,2,3,4] <br/> Output: 5 <br/> Explanation: <br/> heights:  [5,1,2,3,4] <br/> expected: [1,2,3,4,5] <br/> All indices do not match. <br/> <br/><b>- Example</b> 3: <br/> Input: heights = [1,2,3,4,5] <br/> Output: 0 <br/> Explanation: <br/> heights:  [1,2,3,4,5] <br/> expected: [1,2,3,4,5] <br/> All indices match. <br/>   Constraints: <br/> 1 <= heights.length <= 100 <br/> 1 <= heights[i] <= 100
