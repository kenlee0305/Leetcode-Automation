# 117. Crawler Log Folder
### Difficulty: Easy
The Leetcode file system keeps a log each time some user performs a change folder operation. <br/> The operations are described below: <br/> "../" : Move to the parent folder of the current folder. (If you are already in the main folder, remain in the same folder). <br/> "./" : Remain in the same folder. <br/> "x/" : Move to the child folder named x (This folder is guaranteed to always exist). <br/> You are given a list of strings logs where logs[i] is the operation performed by the user at the ith step. <br/> The file system starts in the main folder, then the operations in logs are performed. <br/> Return the minimum number of operations needed to go back to the main folder after the change folder operations. <br/>   <br/><b>- Example</b> 1: <br/> Input: logs = ["d1/","d2/","../","d21/","./"] <br/> Output: 2 <br/> Explanation: Use this change folder operation "../" 2 times and go back to the main folder. <br/> <br/><b>- Example</b> 2: <br/> Input: logs = ["d1/","d2/","./","d3/","../","d31/"] <br/> Output: 3 <br/> <br/><b>- Example</b> 3: <br/> Input: logs = ["d1/","../","../","../"] <br/> Output: 0 <br/>   Constraints: <br/> 1 <= logs.length <= 103 <br/> 2 <= logs[i].length <= 10 <br/> logs[i] contains lowercase English letters, digits, '.', and '/'. <br/> logs[i] follows the format described in the statement. <br/> Folder names consist of lowercase English letters and digits.
