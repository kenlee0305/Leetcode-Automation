# 93. Range Sum of BST
### Difficulty: Easy
Given the root node of a binary search tree and two integers low and high, return the sum of values of all nodes with a value in the inclusive range [low, high]. <br/>   <br/><b>- Example</b> 1: <br/> Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,null,18], low = 7, high = 15 <br/> Output: 32 <br/> Explanation: Nodes 7, 10, and 15 are in the range [7, 15]. 7 + 10 + 15 = 32. <br/> <br/><b>- Example</b> 2: <br/> Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,13,18,1,null,6], low = 6, high = 10 <br/> Output: 23 <br/> Explanation: Nodes 6, 7, and 10 are in the range [6, 10]. 6 + 7 + 10 = 23. <br/>   Constraints: <br/> The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 2 * 104]. <br/> 1 <= Node.val <= 105 <br/> 1 <= low <= high <= 105 <br/> All Node.val are unique.
