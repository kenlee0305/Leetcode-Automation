# 97. Next Greater Node In Linked List
### Difficulty: Medium
We are given a linked list with head as the first node.  Let's number the nodes in the list: node_1, node_2, node_3, ... etc. <br/> Each node may have a next larger value: for node_i, next_larger(node_i) is the node_j.val such that j > i, node_j.val > node_i.val, and j is the smallest possible choice.  If such a j does not exist, the next larger value is 0. <br/> Return an array of integers answer, where answer[i] = next_larger(node_{i+1}). <br/> Note that in the example inputs (not outputs) below, arrays such as [2,1,5] represent the serialization of a linked list with a head node value of 2, second node value of 1, and third node value of 5. <br/>   <br/><b>- Example</b> 1: <br/> Input: [2,1,5] <br/> Output: [5,5,0] <br/> <br/><b>- Example</b> 2: <br/> Input: [2,7,4,3,5] <br/> Output: [7,0,5,5,0] <br/> <br/><b>- Example</b> 3: <br/> Input: [1,7,5,1,9,2,5,1] <br/> Output: [7,9,9,9,0,5,0,0] <br/>   Note: <br/> 1 <= node.val <= 10^9 for each node in the linked list. <br/> The given list has length in the range [0, 10000].
