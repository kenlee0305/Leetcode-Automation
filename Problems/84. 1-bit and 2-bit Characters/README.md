# 84. 1-bit and 2-bit Characters
### Difficulty: Easy
We have two special characters: <br/> The first character can be represented by one bit 0. <br/> The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11). <br/> Given a binary array bits that ends with 0, return true if the last character must be a one-bit character. <br/>   <br/><b>- Example</b> 1: <br/> Input: bits = [1,0,0] <br/> Output: true <br/> Explanation: The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character. <br/> So the last character is one-bit character. <br/> <br/><b>- Example</b> 2: <br/> Input: bits = [1,1,1,0] <br/> Output: false <br/> Explanation: The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character. <br/> So the last character is not one-bit character. <br/>   Constraints: <br/> 1 <= bits.length <= 1000 <br/> bits[i] is either 0 or 1.
