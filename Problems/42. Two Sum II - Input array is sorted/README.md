# 42. Two Sum II - Input array is sorted
### Difficulty: Easy
Given an array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. <br/> Return the indices of the two numbers (1-indexed) as an integer array answer of size 2, where 1 <= answer[0] < answer[1] <= numbers.length. <br/> The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice. <br/>   <br/><b>- Example</b> 1: <br/> Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9 <br/> Output: [1,2] <br/> Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. <br/> <br/><b>- Example</b> 2: <br/> Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6 <br/> Output: [1,3] <br/> <br/><b>- Example</b> 3: <br/> Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1 <br/> Output: [1,2] <br/>   Constraints: <br/> 2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 104 <br/> -1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000 <br/> numbers is sorted in non-decreasing order. <br/> -1000 <= target <= 1000 <br/> The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution.
