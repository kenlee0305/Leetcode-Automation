# 121. Sorting the Sentence
### Difficulty: Easy
A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters. <br/> A sentence can be shuffled by appending the 1-indexed word position to each word then rearranging the words in the sentence. <br/> For example, the sentence "This is a sentence" can be shuffled as "sentence4 a3 is2 This1" or "is2 sentence4 This1 a3". <br/> Given a shuffled sentence s containing no more than 9 words, reconstruct and return the original sentence. <br/>   <br/><b>- Example</b> 1: <br/> Input: s = "is2 sentence4 This1 a3" <br/> Output: "This is a sentence" <br/> Explanation: Sort the words in s to their original positions "This1 is2 a3 sentence4", then remove the numbers. <br/> <br/><b>- Example</b> 2: <br/> Input: s = "Myself2 Me1 I4 and3" <br/> Output: "Me Myself and I" <br/> Explanation: Sort the words in s to their original positions "Me1 Myself2 and3 I4", then remove the numbers. <br/>   Constraints: <br/> 2 <= s.length <= 200 <br/> s consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters, spaces, and digits from 1 to 9. <br/> The number of words in s is between 1 and 9. <br/> The words in s are separated by a single space. <br/> s contains no leading or trailing spaces.
