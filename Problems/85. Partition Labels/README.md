# 85. Partition Labels
### Difficulty: Medium
You are given a string s. We want to partition the string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part. <br/> Return a list of integers representing the size of these parts. <br/>   <br/><b>- Example</b> 1: <br/> Input: s = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij" <br/> Output: [9,7,8] <br/> Explanation: <br/> The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij". <br/> This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part. <br/> A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits s into less parts. <br/> <br/><b>- Example</b> 2: <br/> Input: s = "eccbbbbdec" <br/> Output: [10] <br/>   Constraints: <br/> 1 <= s.length <= 500 <br/> s consists of lowercase English letters.
